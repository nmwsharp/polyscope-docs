These settings affect the 3D camera view in polyscope. It is often convenient to set them just before calling `polyscope.init()`, but they may generally be set anywhere.

```python
import polyscope as ps
import numpy as np

ps.set_up_dir("z_up")
ps.set_front_dir("neg_y_front")
ps.set_navigation_style("free")

# initialize
ps.init()
   
# set the camera pose explicitly
ps.look_at((0., 0., 5.), (1., 1., 1.))

# (alternately, use numpy vectors)
ps.look_at(np.array((0., 0., 5.)), np.array((1., 1., 1.)))

# show the GUI
ps.show()
```

### Options

??? func "`#!python set_navigation_style(s)`"

    ##### navigation style
   
    The style of the camera navigation. Affects what happens when you drag to rotate around the 3D view with your mouse.

    This value can be manually set under the `view` menu of the ui. Programmatically, pass a string for the following settings:

    - `'turntable'` The up direction (see below) is always fixed vertically, with rotation along the azumith and altitude directions.
    - `'free'` The camera is free to take any orientation, rotation is always about relative to the current camera.
    - `'planar'` The camera is locked in to a 2D view of the XY plane, with no rotation (see [2D data]([[url.prefix]]/features/2D_data)).

    Default: `'turntable'`.

    Example:
    ```python
    import polyscope as ps
    ps.set_navigation_style("free")

??? func "`#!python get_navigation_style()`"

    Get the current navigation style (see explanation in the setter above). Returns a string.


??? func "`#!python set_up_dir(s)`"

    ##### up direction
    
    Set the default "up" direction for the scene. This setting affects default orientation of the view, the behavior of some navigation styles (esp. `Turntable`), and the orientation of the ground plane.

    This value can be manually set under the `view` menu of the ui. Programmatically, the setting strings are:

    - `'x_up'` The positive X-axis is up.
    - `'neg_x_up'` The negative X-axis is up.
    - `'y_up'` The positive Y-axis is up.
    - `'neg_y_up'` The negative Y-axis is up.
    - `'z_up'` The positive Z-axis is up.
    - `'neg_z_up'` The negative Z-axis is up.
   
    Default: `'y_up'`.

    Example:
    ```python
    import polyscope as ps
    ps.set_up_dir("z_up")
    ```

??? func "`#!python get_up_dir()`"

    Get the current up direction (see explanation in the setter above). Returns a string.

??? func "`#!python set_front_dir(s)`"

    ##### front direction

    Set the default "front" direction for the scene. This setting affects default orientation of the view; the starting camera looks at the front of the data.

    This value is interpeted as if the scene were a cube, and you are specifying which face of the cube is the 'front'. So `z_front` means the +Z face of the cube is the front face, and thus our camera initially points down the -Z axis to look at it.

    This value can be manually set under the `view` menu of the ui. Programmatically, the setting strings are:

    - `'x_front'` The positive X-axis is the front.
    - `'neg_x_front'` The negative X-axis is the front.
    - `'y_front'` The positive Y-axis is the front.
    - `'neg_y_front'` The negative Y-axis is the front.
    - `'z_front'` The positive Z-axis is the front.
    - `'neg_z_front'` The negative Z-axis is the front.

   
    Default: `z_front`.

    Example:
    ```python
    import polyscope as ps
    ps.set_front_dir("z_front")
    ```

??? func "`#!python get_front_dir()`"

    Get the current front direction (see explanation in the setter above). Returns a string.


??? func "`#!python look_at(camera_location, target, fly_to=False)`"

    ##### look at

    Set the camera to be located at the 3D position `camera_location` and looking at the 3D position `target`, both in world coordinates. The up direction for the camera is set to be the scene's up direction. If `fly_to=True`, the camera will smoothly animate to the new configuration.

    The input 3D vectors can be tuples, length-3 numpy arrays, or really anything that can be indexed for three components.

    Example:
    ```python
    polyscope.look_at((0., 0., 5.), (1., 1., 1.))
    ```

??? func "`#!python look_at_dir(camera_location, target, up_dir, fly_to=False)`"
    
    Set the camera to be located at the 3D position `camera_location` and looking at the 3D position `target`, oriented with the up direction `up_dir`, all in world coordinates. If `fly_to=True`, the camera will smoothly animate to the new configuration.

    Note that setting the up direction for the camera view with this function is separate from the scene's up direction with `set_up_dir()`, which affects things like ground plane placement, and manual view manipulation.

    The input 3D vectors can be tuples, length-3 numpy arrays, or really anything that can be indexed for three components.

    Example:
    ```python
    polyscope.look_at_dir((0., 0., 5.), (1., 1., 1.), (-1., -1., 0.))
    ```

??? func "`#!python reset_camera_to_home_view()`"

    ##### reset camera to home view

    Reset the camera view to the home view (a reasonable default view scaled to the scene).

    **Note:** The "home" view is dependent on the data in the scene; it is computed from the bounding boxes of all registered structures to ensure that everything is nicely scaled and in view. As such, one should generally call this function _after_ registering data.

    Example:
    ```python
    ps.reset_camera_to_home_view()
    ```

??? func "`#!python get_view_camera_parameters()`"

    ##### get camera params for view

    Get the camera parameters (intrinsic and extrinsics) that describe the current viewport view. 

    See the section below for additional methods to get values from the camera parameters.

    Example:
    ```python
    curr_params = ps.get_view_camera_parameters()

    # get some data from the parameters
    view_mat = curr_params.get_view_mat()
    fov_vert_deg = curr_params.get_fov_vertical_deg()
    aspect = curr_params.get_aspect()
    pos = curr_params.get_position()
    ```

#### Orthographic view

By default, Polyscope's view uses [perspective projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Perspective_projection). Perspective projections roughly correspond to how images are usually perceived by our eyes and cameras.

Alternately [orthographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#Orthographic_projection) is also supported. Orthographic projections are common in engineering and architecture, because they have the property that distances are preserved in the projected image, regardless of whether the object is near or far from the camera.

![image of perspective and orthographic projection]([[url.prefix]]/media/projection_diagram.jpg)

In perspective mode, zooming (for instance, by manually scrolling the mouse) translates the camera forward in space. In orthographic mode, it instead adjusts the field of view without moving the camera. This is because counter-intuitively, translating the camera forward does not actually change the view in an orthographic projection!


??? func "`#!python set_view_projection_mode(mode_name)`"

    ##### set projection mode

    Set the camera view projection to be either orthographic or perspective (default).

    Example:
    ```python
    # Enable the orthographic view
    ps.set_view_projection_mode("orthographic")

    # Go back to default perspective projection
    ps.set_view_projection_mode("perspective")
    ```

#### Saving/restoring views

The current camera view (location, direction, camera parameters, and window size) can be saved or loaded from a json string. This is useful for quickly setting up repeatable visualizations.

Also, in the Polyscope GUI, this string can be copied to the clipboard at any time via the "copy" hotkey (ctrl-C or cmd-C), or loaded from your current clipboard using the "paste" hotkey (ctrl-V or cmd-V).

??? func "`#!python get_view_as_json()`"

    Get the current view parameters specified as a json string. Returns a string.
    
    Example:
    ```python
    import polyscope as ps
    my_str = ps.get_view_as_json()
    ```
    

??? func "`#!python void set_view_from_json(json_str)`"

    Set the current view to match the parameters specified in the json string.

    Example:
    ```python
    ps.set_view_from_json(my_str);
    ```

## Camera Parameters

`CameraParameters` objects describe a camera view in Polyscope, including its _intrinsics_ (the field of view and aspect ratio), and _extrinsics_ (the location and orientation). These parameters are used both for manipulations of the interactive viewport, as well as creating [Camera View structures]([[url.prefix]]/structures/camera_view/basics) which are visualized as part of the content in your scene.

**Example:**
```python
import polyscope as ps

# construct camera parameters
intrinsics = ps.CameraIntrinsics(fov_vertical_deg=60., aspect=2.)
extrinsics = ps.CameraExtrinsics(root=(2., 2., 2.), look_dir=(-1., 0., 0.), up_dir=(0.,1.,0.))
params = ps.CameraParameters(intrinsics, extrinsics)

# set the viewport view to those parameters
ps.set_view_camera_parameters(params)

# get the current viewport view
curr_params = ps.get_view_camera_parameters()

# or, use the parameters to create a camera view
cam = ps.register_camera_view("cam1", params)
```

### Camera Intrinsics

A `CameraIntrinsics` object describes the field of view and aspect ratio of a camera. It **does not** describe a "pixel resolution" for a camera---you could have many images of different resolutions all associated with the same camera, as long as the aspect ratios are right.

Camera intrinsics can be created by specifying any pair of vertical field of view, horizontal field of view, and aspect ratio.

??? func "`#!python CameraIntrinsics(fov_vertical_deg=None, fov_horizontal_deg=None, aspect=None)`"

    Construct camera intrinsics. You must specify **exactly two** of the following parameters

    - `fov_vertical_deg` vertical field of view in degrees
    - `fov_horizontal_deg` horizontal field of view in degrees
    - `aspect` aspect ratio, as `width / height`

    **Example:**
    ```python
    intrinsics = ps.CameraIntrinsics(fov_vertical_deg=60., aspect=2.)
    ```


### Camera Extrinsics

A `CameraExtrinsics` object describes the location and orientation of a camera. It can be defined by the forward/up/right axes of the camera in world coordinates, or via an extrinsic matrix, typically denoted `E`, which maps points in world coordinates to points in the camera's local coordinate system. Polyscope uses openGL conventions for camera space, such that the camera points toward the -Z axis, with +Y pointing up and +X pointing right.

Camera extrinsics can be created by specifying frame axes or an extrinsic matrix.

??? func "`#!python CameraExtrinsics(root=None, look_dir=None, up_dir=None, mat=None)`"

    Construct camera extrinsics.

    You must specify either **all three of**:

    - `root` the world-space position of the camera
    - `look_dir` a world-space unit vector along which the camera looks
    - `up_dir` a world-space unit vector defining the up axis for the camera
    
    **Or specify**:
    - `mat` a 4x4 matrix mapping points in world-space to local camera space. Polyscope's camera space uses openGL convention.

    All vectors and matrices should be numpy arrays, or something which a numpy array can be constructed from (like a tuple of floats).

    **Example:**
    ```python
    extrinsics = ps.CameraExtrinsics(root=(2., 2., 2.), look_dir=(-1., 0., 0.), up_dir=(0.,1.,0.))
    ```


### Camera Parameters

The `CameraParameters` object combines a set of intrinsics and extrinsics to fully define a camera.


??? func "`#!python CameraParameters(intrinsics, extrinsics)`"

    Construct camera parameters from intrinsics and extrinsics.

    **Example:**
    ```python
    intrinsics = ps.CameraIntrinsics(fov_vertical_deg=60., aspect=2.)
    extrinsics = ps.CameraExtrinsics(root=(2., 2., 2.), look_dir=(-1., 0., 0.), up_dir=(0.,1.,0.))
    params = ps.CameraParameters(intrinsics, extrinsics)
    ```


Various getters access the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the parameters object.
```python
# intrinsics
CameraParameters.get_fov_vertical_deg()
CameraParameters.get_aspect()

# extrinsics
CameraParameters.get_T()
CameraParameters.get_R()
CameraParameters.get_view_mat()     # synonym for get_E()
CameraParameters.get_E()
CameraParameters.get_position()
CameraParameters.get_look_dir()
CameraParameters.get_up_dir()
CameraParameters.get_right_dir()
CameraParameters.get_camera_frame() # <look, up, right> world-space vectors
```


#### Generating pixel rays

It is often necessary to generate the world-space ray corresponding to each pixel of an image in a camera view. The base point for these rays is easy, it is just `params.get_position()`. However the ray directions vary-per pixel; the `CameraParameters` object has two helpers to automatically construct these rays.

??? func "`#!python CameraParameters.generate_camera_rays(dims, image_origin='upper_left')`"

    Generate an array of rays corresponding to an image with the given resolution `dims=(w,h)`. The result is a `[h,w,3]` numpy buffer. Ray origins are all implicitly given by `params.get_position()`.

    **Example:**
    ```python
    rays = params.generate_camera_rays((300,200))
    ```

??? func "`#!python CameraParameters.generate_camera_ray_corners()`"

    Generate the rays corresponding to the [upperleft, upperright, lowerleft, lowerright] corners of the camera's view. 

    This method is useful because the caller can easily linearly interpolate the normalize get ray directions for all pixels in an image, but this method just needs to return a small amount of data. This makes it easy to e.g. generate rays for a real-time renderer on a GPU, without transferring a whole buffer of ray directions for each frame.
