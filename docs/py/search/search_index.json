It allows you to register your data and quickly generate informative and beautiful visualizations, either programmatically or via a dynamic GUI. Polyscope is designed to be lightweight\u2014it does not \u201ctake ownership\u201d over your entire program, and it is easy to integrate with existing codebases and popular libraries. The lofty objective of Polyscope is to offer a useful visual interface to your data via a single line of code.</p> <p>Polyscope uses a paradigm of structures and quantities. A structure is a geometric object in the scene, such as a surface mesh or point cloud. A quantity is data associated with a structure, such as a scalar function or a vector field.</p> <p>When any of these structures and quantities are registered, Polyscope displays them in an interactive 3D scene, handling boilerplate concerns such as toggling visibility, color-mapping data and adjusting maps, \u201cpicking\u201d to click in the scene and query numerical quantities, etc.</p> <p>Note: There are two variants of this documentation, for C++ and Python. Use the buttons on the top bar to change language.</p> <p>A simple workflow for visualizing data in Polyscope looks like:</p> PythonC++ <pre><code>import polyscope as ps\n\n# Initialize polyscope\nps.init()\n\n### Register a point cloud\n# `my_points` is a Nx3 numpy array\nps.register_point_cloud(\"my points\", my_points)\n\n### Register a mesh\n# `verts` is a Nx3 numpy array of vertex positions\n# `faces` is a Fx3 array of indices, or a nested list\nps.register_surface_mesh(\"my mesh\", verts, faces, smooth_shade=True)\n\n# Add a scalar function and a vector function defined on the mesh\n# vertex_scalar is a length V numpy array of values\n# face_vectors is an Fx3 array of vectors per face\nps.get_surface_mesh(\"my mesh\").add_scalar_quantity(\"my_scalar\", \n        vertex_scalar, defined_on='vertices', cmap='blues')\nps.get_surface_mesh(\"my mesh\").add_vector_quantity(\"my_vector\", \n        face_vectors, defined_on='faces', color=(0.2, 0.5, 0.5))\n\n# View the point cloud and mesh we just registered in the 3D UI\nps.show()\n</code></pre> <pre><code>#include \"polyscope/polyscope.h\"\n#include \"polyscope/surface_mesh.h\"\n\n// Initialize polyscope\npolyscope::init();\n\n// Register a point cloud\n// `points` is a Nx3 array-like container of points\npolyscope::registerPointCloud(\"my points\", points)\n\n// Register a surface mesh structure\n// `meshVerts` is a Vx3 array-like container of vertex positions\n// `meshFaces` is a Fx3 array-like container of face indices  \npolyscope::registerSurfaceMesh(\"my mesh\", meshVerts, meshFaces);\n\n// Add a scalar and a vector function defined on the mesh\n// `scalarQuantity` is a length V array-like container of values\n// `vectorQuantity` is an Fx3 array-like container of vectors per face\npolyscope::getSurfaceMesh(\"my mesh\")-&gt;addVertexScalarQuantity(\"my_scalar\", scalarQuantity);\npolyscope::getSurfaceMesh(\"my mesh\")-&gt;addFaceVectorQuantity(\"my_vector\", vectorQuantity);\n\n// View the point cloud and mesh we just registered in the 3D UI\npolyscope::show();\n</code></pre> <p>Polyscope is designed to make your life easier.

Please file an issue asking first if you are unsure! Of course, bugfixes and additions to the Python binding layer itself are an exception.</p> <p>Conversely, any new C++ features are strongly encouraged to add corresponding Python bindings! See below.</p> <p>A few general pointers:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The UI (menus, dialogs, buttons, etc) is managed using Dear ImGUI, which is very well-documented and has many resources available online.</p> </li> <li> <p>Core rendering logic and shaders are implemented in the <code>/render</code> subdirectory, particularly <code>engine.h</code>. The engine is written to abstract over rendering backends, but at the moment only openGL is supported. There is also a \u201cmock\u201d backend for testing; new rendering features should be mirrored in both <code>gl_engine.cpp</code> and <code>mock_gl_engine.cpp</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Polyscope shaders use a custom in-house shader builder, which performs string manipulation with a simple substitution language to build shaders at runtime which support optional features like slice planes, transparency, different quantity visualization policies, etc. The shaders themselves also explicitly track some metadata like what attributes and uniforms they require. Examples of base shaders can be found e.g. here, and substitution rules here. For any shader or rule to be available in Polyscope, it must be registered in <code>GLEngine::populateDefaultShadersAndRules()</code>, and also in the corresponding function of the mock engine for testing.</p> </li> <li> <p>If adding a new structure or quantity, be sure to make use of the data adaptors for all user inputs. See here for an example. Generally, this means functions which take user data should be templated, and the input then passed through <code>standardizeArray&lt;&gt;()</code> or <code>standardizeVectorArray&lt;&gt;()</code>, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>If adding new options or parameters to a structure/quantity. Be sure to follow proper encapsulation principles (create getters &amp; setters), and use a persistent values. Check out <code>PointCloud::pointColor</code> for a good basic example.  Also, all length-valued quantities should use scaled values (as in <code>PointCloud::pointRadius</code>).</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/contributing/#unit-testing","title":"Unit testing","text":"<p>Whenever possible, add a unit test that somehow exercises any new functionality or verifies that the bug has been fixed.  Polyscope uses the googletest testing framework. See documentation there for test macros, executable options, etc.</p> <p>In a perfect world, we would actually test that the rendered output from Polyscope is pixel-perfect. However, this is hard for a lot of reasons, so instead most of our tests are just \u201csmoke tests\u201d that call functions with some dummy data and ensure no errors are thrown.</p> <p>In fact, these tests are often run on headless servers, where we cannot even initialize an openGL environment. For this reason, in addition to the usual <code>openGL</code> backend, we also have an <code>openGL_mock</code> backend (implemented here) for testing on headless servers. This backend cannot actually render anything, but still performs many rendering-related sanity checks.  If making changes to the rendering engine &amp; shaders, you may find that changes need to be mirrored in <code>mock_gl_engine.cpp</code>.</p> <p>To run unit tests locally on your own machine (here, via unix terminal commands), use</p> <pre><code>cd test\nmkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..\nmake -j4 \n./bin/polyscope-test backend=openGL3_glfw\n</code></pre> <p>which should create a window onscreen and run tests for a few seconds.</p> <p>Additionally, run the tests again like</p> <pre><code>./bin/polyscope-test </code></pre> <p>which will use the <code>openGL_mock</code> backend (you will not see anything onscreen).

Polyscope docs use the mkdocs documentation engine, with the mkdocs-material theme (this theme is quite large and adds significant functionality beyond base mkdocs). The documentation is written in a large collection of markdown files; it is not automatically scraped from the code, or code comments, etc, so we must manually keep it up to date.</p> <p>There are two duplicate copies of all the docs for C++ and Python, stored in parallel directories <code>/cpp</code> and <code>/py</code>. A few shared files and assets are stored in the <code>/shared</code> directory, or symlinked from the <code>/py</code> subdirectory to point to a file the <code>/cpp</code> directory. We try to keep these two parallel versions in sync as much as possible, only differing where necessary between C++ and Python.</p> <p>To preview the documentation while editing, first install the necessary packages with <code>pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material==6.2.8 mkdocs-macros-plugin pygments</code>. Then run <code>python3 -m mkdocs serve</code> (run this command from the <code>/cpp</code> directory to view C++ docs, and likewise for <code>/py</code>). A local address will be printed to your terminal, which you can navigate to in-browser to see the docs.</p> <p>Hopefully editing the docs markdown files should be self-evident, you can mainly copy existing content &amp; formatting. Any new files need to be added the manifests in <code>mkdocs.yml</code>.

We use nanobind to generate bindings. These bindings are kept as thin wrappers as much as possible, just doing a minimal translation between the C++ interface and typical Python calling conventions.</p> <p>The bindings are actually managed internally as two separate Python packages: <code>polyscope_bindings</code> (which contains the raw bindings generated by our nanobind code), and the higher-level <code>polyscope</code> (which contains the actual, nice user-facing Python functions). The separation is because there is no way to write additional Python code in the nanobind-generated package, but we often want to do some translation and error checking on the Python side before invoking the bindings. As such, adding a binding generally means writing code in two places:</p> <ol> <li>Add a new nanobind C++ binding, like those here</li> <li>Add a new Python wrapper function which calls the generated binding, like the ones here</li> </ol> <p>Note that a few stylistic conventions between Python and C++. In particular, we do not expose classes for quantities, but set options via optional keyword arguments when the quantity is added. The nanobind C++ bindings take Eigen arrays as arguments, because nanobind performs automatic translation between Eigen/numpy.</p> <p>Python binding unit tests are stored in <code>/test/polyscope_test.py</code>. As with C++, these are mainly just simple \u201csmoke tests\u201d which call the functions with dummy data and ensure no errors are thrown. All new bindings functions need a test! To build and test the bindings, first compile the bindings from the <code>polyscope-py</code> root directory like <pre><code>mkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake -j8\n</code></pre> the run <code>python polyscope_test.py</code>. As you write code, these bindings must be recompiled to reflect any changes to the nanobind C++. When testing, make sure there is not another copy of Polyscope for Python installed in your system, which might unintentionally be used instead of the development version! Also, the adjacent <code>demo_app.py</code> can be used for simple testing.</p> <p>Don\u2019t forget, the Python bindings have a parallel set of docs in the <code>/py</code> directory. Updates to Python should be reflected there.</p> <p>When all your tests are passing, create a pull request! As with C++, submitting a pull request to the Python bindings will trigger a cloud build and some automated checks.</p> <p>Actually deploying a new Python version to <code>pip</code> and <code>conda</code> package managers is a somewhat significant process, so we typically group together updates before cutting a new version.  Ping @nmwsharp to get a new version deployed.
