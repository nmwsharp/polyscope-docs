# Surface Meshes

Surface meshes are one of the core structures in Polyscope. In addition to simply displaying the mesh, Polyscope can show any number of scalar, vector,color, and other kinds of quantities associated with the vertices/faces/edges/etc of the mesh.

Polyscope does not impose any requirements on the meshes visualized. They may be polygonal or nonmanifold.  As always, try clicking on the vertices or faces of a mesh see the data associated with that mesh element.

## Registering a surface mesh

Example: registering a surface mesh from libIGL
```cpp
#include "polyscope/polyscope.h"
#include "polyscope/surface_mesh.h"
#include <igl/readOBJ.h>

// Initialize Polyscope
polyscope::init();

// Read the mesh
Eigen::MatrixXd meshV;
Eigen::MatrixXi meshF;
igl::readOBJ(filename, meshV, meshF);

// Register the mesh with Polyscope
polyscope::registerSurfaceMesh("input mesh", meshV, meshF);

// Show the GUI
polyscope::show();
```

Surface meshes are registered with Polyscope by passing the location of each vertex in the mesh, as well as the vertex indices for each face.

??? func "`#!cpp polyscope::registerSurfaceMesh(std::string name, const V& vertexPositions, const F& faceIndices)`"

    Add a new surface mesh structure to Polyscope.

    - `vertexPositions` is the vector array of 3D vertex locations. The type should be [adaptable]([[url.prefix]]/data_adaptors) to an array of `float`-valued 3-vectors; this allows many common types to be used as input, including `Eigen::MatrixXd` and `std::vector<std::array<double, 3>>`. The length will be the number of vertices.

    - `faceIndices` is the nested array of vertex indices for each face. The type should be [adaptable]([[url.prefix]]/data_adaptors) to a nested array of `size_t`; this allows many common types to be used as input, including `Eigen::MatrixXi` and `std::vector<std::array<size_t, 3>>`. The outer length will be the number of faces. All indices should be valid 0-based indices in to the vertex list.

    General nested lists can be used to create polygonal meshes of varying face degree, such as `std::vector<std::vector<size_t>>`. Also, passing a fixed-size 2D array of indices will work just fine, like `Eigen::MatrixXi` with `Fx3` dimensions for a triangle mesh, or `Fx4` for a quad mesh.
    
    Note: the inner vector type of the vertex positions _must_ be 3D dimensional, or you risk compiler errors, segfaults, or worse. If you want to register a 2D surface mesh, `registerSurfaceMesh2D` exists with the same signature. See [2D data]([[url.prefix]]/features/2D_data).

!!! warning "Element ordering"

    Polyscope quantities are ordered arrays of data, but not everyone can agree on the ordering of elements in a mesh. See [indexing conventions](../indexing_convention/).

    The default ordering is probably the same as yours for data on **vertices, faces, and corners**. However, data on **edges and halfedges** is much more likely to require setting an ordering.


## Updating a mesh

The locations of the vertices in a mesh can be updated with the member function `updateVertexPositions(newPositions)`. All quantities will be preserved. Changing the connectivity or element counts in a mesh is not supported, you will need to register a new mesh (perhaps with the same name to overwrite).


??? func "`#!cpp void SurfaceMesh::updateVertexPositions(const V& newPositions)`"

    Update the vertex positions in a surface mesh structure.

    - `newPositions` is the vector array of 3D vertex locations. The type should be [adaptable]([[url.prefix]]/data_adaptors) to an array of `float`-valued 3-vectors.  The length must be equal to the current number of vertices.

    Note: `updateVertexPositions2D` exists with the same signature. See [2D data]([[url.prefix]]/features/2D_data).


### Selection / Picking

"Picking" refers to selecting and inspecting elements by clicking on the object in the scene. As with other structures, you can call `interpretPickResult()` to get additional info about a click. See [the overview of Selection / Picking]([[url.prefix]]/basics/interactive_UIs_and_animation/#selection-picking) for general information about selection. 

```cpp
struct SurfaceMeshPickResult {
  MeshElement elementType;  // which kind of element did we click (enum values: [VERTEX, FACE, EDGE, HALFEDGE, CORNER])
  int64_t index;            // index of the clicked element
  glm::vec3 baryCoords;     // coordinates in face, populated only for triangular face picks
};
```

??? func "`#!cpp SurfaceMeshPickResult SurfaceMesh::interpretPickResult(PickResult result)`"

    Get additional information about a click on a mesh.


??? func "`#!cpp SurfaceMeshPickResult SurfaceMesh::interpretPickResult(const PickResult& result)`"

    Get additional mesh-specific info about a pick result. This function is only valid to call on the structure which the pick hit.
    
    `PickResults` usually come from calling `pickAtScreenCoords()`.


We can also set which mesh elements are selectable (for instance, to make only vertices be returned from pick queries). This option can be set programmatically as `SurfaceMesh::setSelectionMode(MeshSelectionMode newMode)`, or from the UI. The available selection modes are:

- `MeshSelectionMode::Auto`: Vertices and faces can always be selected. Edges, corners, halfedges can only be selected once they are in-use by some quantity. You can manually call `SurfaceMesh::markEdgesAsUsed()`, to act as if edges are in use and make them pickable, etc. The same goes for `SurfaceMesh::markCornersAsUsed()` and `SurfaceMesh::markHalfedgesAsUsed()`. If you mark edges or halfedges as used, you much also set their element ordering as described in the [indexing conventions](../indexing_convention/).

- `MeshSelectionMode::VerticesOnly`: Only vertices can be selected

- `MeshSelectionMode::FacesOnly`: Only faces can be selected



## Back face policies

The faces of a mesh are implicitly given an outward orientation by the order in which the vertices are listed. The standard convention, which Polyscope respects, is that a counter-clockwise ordering of vertices defines the "outward" direction. Faces which are viewed from behind are referred to as _back faces_; they can arise when a surface is viewed from the inside, or if a mesh is not properly oriented. Polyscope offers several options for how back faces are displayed.

![backface policies diagram](../../media/backface_diagram.png)

- `BackFacePolicy::Identical` all faces are always rendered identically, whether viewed from the front or back
- `BackFacePolicy::Different` back faces are shaded slightly darker, so they can be distinguished (this is the default)
- `BackFacePolicy::Custom` back faces are shaded with a configurable color
- `BackFacePolicy::Cull` back faces are culled, and not rendered at all

The choice of these policies can be set as an option for each surface mesh structure, either in the GUI via `[Options] -> [Back Face Policy]` or programmatically with the function below.

??? func "`#!cpp SurfaceMesh* SurfaceMesh::setBackFacePolicy(BackFacePolicy newPolicy)`"

    Set the policy for rendering oppositely-oriented back faces.

    - `newPolicy` is an enum giving the new policy, one of `BackFacePolicy::Identical`, `BackFacePolicy::Different`, `BackFacePolicy::Custom`, or `BackFacePolicy::Cull` as described above

    There is also a corresponding `getBackFacePolicy()`.

??? func "`#!cpp SurfaceMesh* SurfaceMesh::setBackFaceColor(glm::vec3 val)`"

    Set the color to be used for custom back face coloring. Has no effect unless the back face policy is `BackFacePolicy::Custom`.

    There is also a corresponding `getBackFaceColor()`.
