## Using messages

We've all been there: a crucial error message gets printed to the terminal, but lost in a tempest of text---noticing that error message could have saved two hours of debugging.  Polyscope contains a simple system for showing message dialogs in the UI which are sure to be noticed but stay out of the way.

There are a few levels of messages available:

- **error** A very bad error; immediately shows and blocks the UI for user response.
- **terminating error** Like `error`, but terminates the program after being dismissed.
- **warning** A medium priorty warning, shown the next time UI main loop executes. Warnings of the same type can be batched together, so these messages can be issued in a dense loop without drowning the program.
- **info** A low-priority message, which is just printed to `stdout`.

Messages can be dismissed by clicking the button in dialog box, or pressing `[space]`.

Example:
```cpp
#include "polyscope/polyscope.h"

// Generate a single warning.
// Has no effect on the GUI until polyscope gets control flow
// back, which happens here in the show() call below.
polyscope::warning("Something went slightly wrong");

// Generate a lot of warnings. Becase all of these warnings 
// have the same base message (the first string), they will 
// be batched together and only shown as one dialog. The detail 
// message for the first such warning will also be shown.
for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
  polyscope::warning("Some problems come in groups", 
    "detail = " + std::to_string(i));
}

// The previous warnings would be displayed here
polyscope::show();

// Generating an error.
// The UI will block and show this error immediately. After 
// the error is dismissed, the call will return.
polyscope::error("Resistance is futile.");

// Generate a fatal error.
// After the error is dismissed, the program will terminate.
polyscope::terminatingError("Resistance is futile.");

// Disable the in-window popups, just print to stdout
polyscope::options::displayMessagePopups = false;
```


### Messages

??? func "`#!cpp void polyscope::info(std::string message)`"
    
    ##### info

    Simply logs a message to `stdout`.


??? func "`#!cpp void polyscope::warning(std::string baseMessage, std::string detailMessage = "")`"
    
    ##### warning

    Create a warning message, to be displayed the next time the UI gets flow control. 

    When issuing a one-off warning, the `detailMessage` field need not be used.  However, if issuing warnings in a loop, warnings with the same `baseMessage` are batched together, so the UI doesn't get completely overwhelmed.

    Example:
    ```cpp
    #include "polyscope/polyscope.h"

    // Generate a single warning.
    // Has no effect on the GUI until polyscope gets control flow
    // back, which happens here in the show() call below.
    polyscope::warning("Something went slightly wrong");

    // Generate a lot of warnings. Becase all of these warnings 
    // have the same base message (the first string), they will 
    // be batched together and only shown as one dialog. The detail 
    // message for the first such warning will also be shown.
    for (int i = 0; i < 5000; i++) {
      polyscope::warning("Some problems come in groups", 
        "detail = " + std::to_string(i));
    }

    // The previous warnings would be displayed here
    polyscope::show();
    ```


??? func "`#!cpp void polyscope::error(std::string message)`"

    ##### error
  
    Generate an error, which is immediately shown in the GUI. After the error dialog is dismissed in the GUI, this function returns.

??? func "`#!cpp void polyscope::terminatingError(std::string message)`"

    ##### terminating error
    
    Generate an error, which is immediately shown in the GUI. After the error dialog is dismissed in the GUI, the program terminates.

### Options

??? func "`#!cpp bool options::displayMessagePopups`"

    ##### display message popups

    If `true`, warning and error popup dialogs are shown in the UI **and** printed to stdout. If `false`, they are only printed to stdout (assuming `verbosity > 0`).

    Default: `true`
